        Q5. Extend the application to include nested routes for a more complex
        user interface. Create a new section of your application (e.g., a
        Dashboard) with multiple sub-pages (e.g., Dashboard, Profile, Settings).
        Implement nested routing within this section using nested routes. Add
        navigation links to switch between the sub-pages within the Dashboard
        section. Customize the content displayed on each sub-page.
